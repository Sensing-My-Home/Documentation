The application should provide tasks in order to keep the plants healthy, as well as offer tips about how users should care for them. This will hopefully allow users to have a better sucess rate in growing different types of plants, in an environment where people's daily worries makes them forget about the tasks they should perform. With this project we intend to aid experienced and non-experienced users to care for their plants and become sucessfull in raising them. We plan to implement sensors in certain division and plants as well (premium user) in order to better calculate what a certain plant needs to continue healthy.

Thus, and considering the app will be developed for mobile devices, its interface should be easy to learn and intuitive, and be validated with usability tests with users representing this varied background. Reliability The different subsystems of the architecture should be well connected and reliable. When system errors happen, the application should be responsive, so the user realizes what is happening and doesn\u2019t abandon the system. Scalability The user should be able to connect new sensors to their account whenever needed and associate these sensors with different divisions and plants. Thus, the architecture of the message broker should be implemented with this in mind. The app should be able to accommodate multiple users connecting at the same time. Security Given that the application won\u2019t deal with sensitive data from its users, the focus on our project will be on the protection of the login information of the users. This will be dealt not only with password encryption and the development of an authentication and authorization system, but also with the implementation of token-based authentication and security methods on the API itself. Interoperability The mobile application is required to connect with different sensors used to monitor the plants belonging to the user (temperature and humidity sensors, as well as soil moisture sensors). In the context of the development during this project, the connection will be made via middleware installed on a Raspberry Pi. Efficiency Given that mobile devices have limited storage and battery resources, the development of the mobile app should be made in an efficient manner in order to optimize the system. The Android guidelines for application optimization should be followed. System Architecture \u00b6 Domain Model \u00b6 Users The Users of the application can either be premium, with access to the features of the app relating to the integration of sensors, or non-premium. Either way, internally, all Users will have a rating that will be used to measure their experience with the app and their experience growing plants. This rating will be employed as part of the reputation system that will be implemented for the user suggestions forum for each plant in the app catalogue. Users will also be able to register in their account all the plants they want to monitor in their house. Plants The association between User and Plant is one-to-many, to represent the inventory of plants of each user, since a user can have several plants in their inventory. Each plant will have a set of information related to the details described by the User, such as the plantation date or the size of the pot used. Besides, all plants will belong to one of the Plant Species catalogued in the system database. The stats about the plants, as well as their optimal conditions, will be used to determine each Plants estimated plant condition. This will be implemented using a \u201ctraffic lights\u201d system which will allow the User to glance at first sight which plants in their inventory currently need attention - with red signaling the need for immediate attention, green signalling that the plant is in a healthy state, and yellow signaling an intermediate state between both. The estimation of the plant condition can be better measured by the association of sensors to each plant, in the case of Premium Users. Plant Species Each plant species will have their ideal conditions for growth registered, and also include their optimal temperature, optimal luminosity, optimal humidity and watering frequency. They will be evaluated according to a scale suggested by the University of Georgia: Condition Levels in Scale Scale Description Light 4 1 - Sunny light areas: At least 4 hours of direct sun 2 \u2013 High-light area: Over 200 ft-c, but not direct sun 3 \u2013 Medium-light areas: 75 ft-c to 200 ft-c 4 - Low-light areas: 25 ft-c to 75 ft-c Temperature 3 1 \u2013 Cool: 10\u00baC at night; 18 \u00baC at day 2 \u2013 Average: 18\u00baC at night; 25 \u00baC at day 3 \u2013 Warm: 25\u00baC at night; 30 \u00baC at day Relative Humidity 3 1 \u2013 High: 50% or higher 2 \u2013 Average: 25% to 49% 3 \u2013 Low: 5% to 24% Watering 3 1 \u2013 Keep soil mix moist 2 \u2013 Surface of soil mix should dry before re-watering 3 \u2013 Soil mix can become moderately dry before re-watering Divisions For each Plant, the user can register in which Division of their house the pot is located. As such, it will be possible to measure the different air humidity and temperature values through sensors in those divisions. Species Family Each species belongs to a Species Family, which determines their ideal soil mix * Flowering House Plants * Foliage Plants * Bromeliads * Orchids * Succulents and Cacti * Ferns * African Violets and other Gesneriads Tasks The tasks related to the care for each plant will have a status associated to them ( to be completed or done ) and will also be used to determine the current condition of a plant. Sensors Premium Users will be able to associate two types of Sensors to their account: either Plant Sensors , that measure a parameter that varies from individual plant to individual plant (i.e., their soil moisture), or Division Sensors , which monitor parameters that don\u2019t vary from plant to plant but that are actually dependent on environmental conditions (i.e., the air humidity and temperature). A record for all the measurements will be kept and sensors will also produce notifications in case a measure has worrying values. Deployment Diagram \u00b6 The architecture of the solution will be divided into 4 main modules: the Frontend, the Backend, the Storage and the Sensors Architecture. Frontend \u00b6 The frontend of the system will consist of a mobile application, developed using the React Native framework , for the Android OS, and a web dashboard, developed using React . The mobile app will be the user\u2019s interface with our service, while the web dashboard will be used by system administrators to manage the plant catalogue in the database. The choice of the React frameworks for the implementation of this module is due to its component-based development and the ease with which we can use additional libraries for routing and client-side functionality. These characteristics make the React framework ideal to implement a well-designed and usable responsive interface for the users in a relatively simple and fast manner, while keeping the code easy to test, to read and to maintain. Backend \u00b6 The backend of the system will consist of a REST API, that will serve has an interface both the Frontend and the Storage layers while processing business logic, and the Rabbit MQ message queue, which will be used has a broker to receive the measurements data from the sensors and exchange this information with the storage module. The REST API will be developed on the Spring Framework , which also allows the easy implementation of a data modelling and processing layer, using Spring Data , as well has the addition of authorization and authentication mechanisms for the API protection using Spring Security . Storage \u00b6 For the storage module, we will use two databases: Postgres SQL will be used for the implementation of a relational database that will hold the information about the users, their profiles, their inventory of plants, the tasks related to their inventory, etc, as well as the catalogue of the different species supported by the platform, as well as the information characterizing these different species. We decided to use relational databases to model this part of the architecture, since they ensure ACID properties, have high query processing speed and keep data transactions secure. Sensors Architecture \u00b6 We will use influxDB , a timeseries database, to hold the records of the measurements made by sensors, as we feel like the relational model is not appropriate to model this sort of data. Redis will be used to store session information, and to cache some queries for the relational database. We will also use Nginx as a reverse proxy web server, that will receive network traffic and control access to the application, serving as caching and load balancer that will allows us to decrease the loading time of the pages and to avoid congestions on the network traffic, thus increasing the performance, availability and scalability of the service.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#about-our-project","text":"GrowMate is an application where we allow users of different types to create and manage an inventory of plants they can manage.
